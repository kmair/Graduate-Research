Convex Test Problems collected by Luis M Rios lmrios@gmail.com, July 2009

The following files provide source to compile standalone executable programs
of the random instances generated with varying sizes from 4 families of convex
problems.
Sizes include 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 200, and 300 variables.
For each of different problem size, five random instances were generated for
Richtarik's, Powell's and both variants of Nesterov's problems.

The script 'generate.convex' compile all models.
The compiler used is 'gcc'. 

The resulting 208 executable programs read the input from the file 'input.in'
and returns the objective function value in the file 'output.out'.
The input file must have each variable's value in each line. 

The executable programs are named:
convex<family>_<size>_<instance>

The families of problems are described below:

Family 1
Richtarik's piece-wise linear problems:
\min_x \max_i \{ | \langle a_i,x \rangle | : i = 1,2,\ldots,m \},

Family 2
Nesterov's quadratic test problems:
Y. Nesterov: "Gradient methods for minimizing composite objective function"
Optimization Online Digest, September 2007

\min_x \frac{1}{2} \|Ax-b\|^2_2 + \|x\|_1,

Family 3
a variant of Nesterov's test problems without the nonsmooth term:
Y. Nesterov: "Gradient methods for minimizing composite objective function"
Optimization Online Digest, September 2007

\min_x \frac{1}{2} \|Ax-b\|^2_2,

Family 4
Powell's \cite{p06} ARWHEAD quadratic test problem:
M. J. D. Powell: "The NEWUOA software for unconstrained optimization without derivatives"
In G. Di Pillo and M. Roma (eds.), Large-Scale Nonlinear Optimization,
Springer, New York, NY; 2006 ; pp 255--297

\min_x \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i^2 + x_n^2)^2 - 4x_i + 3,
