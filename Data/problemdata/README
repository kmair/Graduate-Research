The problemdata files contain information about the test problems
and are expected to be used along with 'mydfo' interface to derivative-free
algorithms.
Test problems are used in the working paper:

Derivative-free optimization: A review of algorithms and comparison of software implementations by Luis Miguel Rios and Nikolaos V. Sahinidis


[problemdata]
The file [problemdata] contains various problem features in the following format:

number of variables (integer)
lower bounds        (float array)
upper bounds        (float array)
starting point      (float array)

the following is an example for a 2-variable problem, where the first variable
has bounds [-10,15] and starting value 0, and the second variable has bounds
[-20,30] and starting value 5.
