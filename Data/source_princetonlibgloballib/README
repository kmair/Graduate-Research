C source code for Princetonlib and Globallib models
 Collected by Luis M Rios lmrios@gmail.com, September 2009

The following C source files were produced from AMPL models using the
'nlc' program from AMPL/solvers/nlc.

The source files require linking to files and libraries included in the AMPL
distribution.
AMPL can be obtained at http://www.ampl.com/

The model standalone executable compiles issuing the following command from the
AMPL directory:

gcc -o $model solvers/nlc/$model.c solvers/nlc/nlcmisc.o solvers/examples/rvmsg.o solvers/examples/keywds.o solvers/funcadd0.o solvers/amplsolver.a -lm -ldl

where:
$model is the model's name
solvers, solvers/nlc and solvers/examples are subdirectories of the AMPL directory

The resulting executable reads the input from the file 'input.in' and returns the
objective function value in the file 'output.out'.
The input file must have each variable's value in each line.
