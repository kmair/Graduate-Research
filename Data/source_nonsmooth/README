FORTRAN source code for Luksan and Vlcek collection of nonsmooth models
Collected by Luis M Rios, lmrios@gmail
September 2009

The following files provide source to compile standalone executable programs
of the nonsmooth models defined by Luksan and Vlcek in:
http://www3.cs.cas.cz/ics/reports/v798-00.ps

The Makefile provided will compile all models when issuing the command 'make'.
If necessary, change the fortran compiler (The default is g77).
The resulting 49 executable programs read the input from the file 'input.in'
and returns the objective function value in the file 'output.out'.
The input file must have each variable's value in each line. 

Source files 'test06.f', 'test19.f' and 'TEST19.DAT' were obtained from:
http://www.cs.cas.cz/luksan/test.html

The remaining FORTRAN files provide each model's definition and calls the
relevant functions from other files.
