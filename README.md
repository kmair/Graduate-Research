# Graduate-Research

The aim of this project is to implement a hybrid machine learning and optimization approach to solve black-box optimization problems. 
Black-box problems are problems for which we do not have an algebraic formulation of the problem we want to optimize.
These problems are often encountered in complex engineering systems.
