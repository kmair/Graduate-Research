C source code for Princetonlib and Globallib models
Collected by Luis M Rios lmrios@gmail.com, September 2009

The following C source files were produced from AMPL models using a custom
AMPL solver that uses the 'nlc' program from AMPL/solvers/nlc.

The C source files can be regenerated using the script generate_codes.sh
The script compiles the custom AMPL solver 'modtocode' that converts an AMPL
.mod model into C source code.
'generate_codes.sh' compiles the port library and the nlc program used by
'modtocode'.

AMPL .mod files are stored in the mod_models directory.
'generate_codes.sh' calls the script convert2source at mod_models, which
converts each AMPL model from the Princetonlib and Globallib collections.
'convert2source' writes an AMPL script, calls modtocode through AMPL and produces
the source.

A binary version of AMPL is included in the mod_models directory.
Check if AMPL is appropriate for the current machine architecture.
